Firstly, please excuse if this documentation is horrible because I have
no idea how to use github.

This fake bank account was created as an attempt to broaden my skills,
and I recently decided to add this captcha, which currently doesn't actually
check your answer or anything for now, it's just for the aesthetics. Also, when you click
'generate new problem', as you may have guessed, it doesn't actually generate a problem,
it just sets the css of display from none to block of an already existing question.

For the math formatting, this thing uses a library called MathJax with LaTeX code.
If you want to change out some problems, there's a txt file called 'math_problems.txt'
which has the html/latex code required for some other math problems that you can just
copy and paste into where the math problems already are (which are taken from Project Euler).

I haven't tested this out on an actual scammer or anything, but the idea for the captcha is to
pretend the first problem is kinda hard, so you would press the button in the box to generate a
new problem and act like the second problem is really easy and just look through and sort
of do those old 'illuminati confirmed' video tactics where you just pick up random details
and make claims that make absolutely no sense and somehow arrive to an answer like 133769420
or something. Also, I'd have to update this, or maybe someone else can, but like I said earlier,
nothing actually happens when you click the submit button.
